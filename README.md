# Diffusion Model Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a diffusion model based on the 2020 paper "[Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)" by Jonathan Ho, Ajay Jain, and Pieter Abbeel. It was developed as the final assignment for the course "Visual Media" at the University of Tokyo in 2024.

## Disclaimer

Since I do not have access to any real computing resources and I am working on a Laptop from 2014, this implementation features a much simpler and smaller architecture than described in the above mentioned paper. The purpose of this implementation is not to produce stunning results, but is to be understood as an exercise in understanding the underlying concepts.

## Requirements

My set up includes:

- Python 3.11
- PyTorch 2.1.0
- Torchvision 0.16.0
- Matplotlib 3.8.1
- Jupyterlab 4.0.8

The code was run on google colab using a free GPU for about two hours.
